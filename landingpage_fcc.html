    <h1 id="About" class="links">About</h1>
    <p class="about-p">Most seating manufacturers take a “one-size-fits-all” approach to product design which may fit many, but won’t fit everyone. ergoCentric believes that everyone should be comfortable at work and our build-to-order, modular manufacturing system allows us to fit every person with the perfect accessories. With our always-in-stock inventory of modular components, we are able to make thousands of different products and we even modify specific components as required. This means that all employees can be sitting on seating with a streamlined aesthetic, with custom modifications to meet the needs of individuals.</p>
    <p class="about-p">We believe the lowest total cost of ownership and not the lowest price is what matters most in the design and supply of office supplies. This belief is demonstrated with our best-in-class warranty, drive for continuous improvement and our non-obsolescence policy.</p>
